# Installation


To set up the dotfiles, run the `install.sh` script located in the `scripts` directory. This script will:

- Copy all files starting with `git` to your home directory.
- Create symbolic links for the remaining configuration files in the home directory.

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```
